        syntx:- setTimeout(callback , timeout);

2. setInterval():- it is a web api used to perform Async operations for 
    syntax:- setInterval(callbackfn , timeinterval);

3. promise(es6 feature):-  it is an object which represents eventual completion or failures of Asynchronous operations.
        states of promise:

            3. finally():- finally will execute both success and failure once promise operations.

4. Async & await:- 
async:- this keyword makes Synchronous as Asynchronousand strat to execute the promise.
wait:- this keyword makes the function
