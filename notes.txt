types of function:
1. named function
2. ananymus function
3. function expression
Arrow function
callback function- call back is a function which is passsed as a value/arguments another function
immediate invoke function
higher order function- higher order function is a function which accepts the another function as a value/argument to its parameter.
closure- closure is a memory created when functions bundled together by giving accesability to the innermost function to access the variability of outermost function. 
closure is a memory which gives the accessibility to access the variables 


Array:-
******************
 - collection of ityems or values.
 - array can store homogenous values  / and heterogenous values.
 - syntax :- [] indicates it is an array.
 - ex :- 
 Arrays can store multiple values in one object

 map and foreach difference:
 map:- it is used to iterate the values of an array





 methods in array:
 **************************
 push(), pop, unsift, reversae, join()

 what is object?
 -object is as entity which is used to store values in the form  of key and value pairs.
 - object is an physical entity whiuch is having states(propertiesd) and behaviours(method)

 syntax :- let obj = {}; without any method

 notes:- object based lanuage + OOPs 

 ex :- let obj ={
    name:"Sam",

        }

json:-

1. local storage:- it is a permanent data storage.
                - it can store upto 10MB.
                local storage.setItem("key" , "value")
                local storage.removeItem("key")

Asynchronous :- making javascript to work multiple work simultaneously.

1. setTimeout():- it is web api used to perform Asynchronous operation in certain timeout.
        syntx:- setTimeout(callback , timeout);

2. setInterval():- it is a web api used to perform Async operations for 
    syntax:- setInterval(callbackfn , timeinterval);

3. promise(es6 feature):-  it is an object which represents eventual completion or failures of Asynchronous operations.
        states of promise:
        1. pending:- still pending
        2. fulfilled:-successfully completed 
        3. rejected:- failures
syntax: let p = new promise((resolve , reject)=>{});

-for handling the promise we have a instance methods,
            1. then():- it is used to habdle successful data.
            2. catch():- it is used to handle errors.
            3. finally():- finally will execute both success and failure once promise operations.

4. Async & await
5.
